# Geomorphometry
This repository contains a collection of geomorphometric analysis scripts developed primarily using Whitebox Workflows and related geospatial tools. These scripts are designed to automate the extraction, processing, and analysis of terrain-based variables for environmental modeling, landform classification, and hydrological applications.
