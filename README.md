# Geomorphometry

This repository contains a collection of geomorphometric analysis scripts developed primarily using [Whitebox Workflows](https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbw-user-manual/book/introduction.html) and related geospatial tools. These scripts are designed to automate the extraction, processing, and analysis of terrain-based variables for environmental modeling, landform classification, and hydrological applications.
